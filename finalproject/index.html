      <h2>A Quick History Lesson</h2>
      <hr>
        <p>
            The area that would come to be known as Leelanau Country was first recognized by the Michigan Legislature around the year 1840, but would not become its own
            legal entity until the year 1863. During this time area would be settled that would eventually become towns such as Leeland, Empire, Suttons Bay, and many others
            were initially settled. There are scattered areas within the county that are controlled by the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, though 
            these are primarily concentrated around the village of Suttons Bay.
            While the county began with what could be classfied as an agrarian economy, with aspects of a seaport due to the surrounding lake. Leelanau has transitioned, into 
            a tourist/retirement based economy in the past 20 years, who flock to the county's plethora of beach communities.

                        Suttons Bay is a Civic Township that is located in between Traverse City and Northport. It is Leelanau's 
                        County Seat, and serves as a gateway to the county at large for many tourists.

    <h3>The Question of the Future</h3>
    <p>
      The question of what the future has in store for Leelanau is, to put it mildly, a contested issue. With the rise in population that 
      has occured in the 2020s, there is an increasing presure on the county to develop, much to the chagrin of those who've called the area 
      home for decades. The push back largely centers around the use of land to develop new housing and infrastructure for those who are moving to
      the area. With many citing the development/suburbanization of once bucolic areas in the southern part of the state as their concern for the future of Leelanau.
      <a href="https://leelanauconservancy.org/" class="mainLink">The Leelanau Conservancy</a> is an organization that is working to counter this to mixed success. As of now
      it's difficult to say which side will win out, though the "limited" nature of the Baby Boomer generation's time, relative to the quantity of people who will replace them 
      is often seen as the strongest argument against allowing for more development than has already occurred.
